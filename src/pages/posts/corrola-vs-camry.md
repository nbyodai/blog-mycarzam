## In general

### Fuel Efficiency: Toyota Camry vs Toyota Corolla

The fuel economy between the Toyota Camry and Toyota Corolla is impressive. This is because the standard versions of both vehicles come with advanced engines that work with [Dual Variable Valve Timing intelligence ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) (Dual VVT-i).
Dual VVT-i works to help the engine use only the necessary amount of gas for the vehicle. This serves to reduce the likelihood of wasting gas and decreased fuel economy.
However, because both vehicles are not powered by the same transmission system, their fuel economy is different. A Toyota Corolla equipped with a standard 1.8L 4-cylinder engine and a Continuously Variable Transmission with intelligence and Shift Mode gets up to an EPA-estimated 32 highway miles per gallon (mpg).
On the other hand, a Toyota Camry with a standard 2.5L I-4 engine works with an Electronically Controlled Automatic Overdrive Transmission with intelligence with Shift Mode gets up to an EPA-estimated 24 highway mpg.

### Comparing their Fuel Efficient Models

Both the Toyota Corolla and the Toyota Camry both come with versions that cater specifically to fuel economy. For example, the Toyota Corolla offers the Toyota Corolla LE Eco.
The same 1.8L 4-cylinder engine and fuel-efficient transmission powers the Toyota Corolla LE Eco. However, the LE Eco’s engine comes with Valvematic technology instead of Dual VVT-i. It is this Valvematic technology that allows the vehicle’s engine to perform more efficiently. The effect of this is a boost up to an EPA-estimated 34 combined mpg for the Toyota Corolla.
In addition to that, the Toyota Corolla LE Eco also includes Eco mode. The Eco mode adjusts the performance of the powertrain and other items under the hood to make the vehicle operate more efficiently, therefore enhancing the vehicle’s overall fuel economy.
The Toyota Camry offers a hybrid model to drivers looking for added fuel economy. In addition to its 2.5L engine, the Toyota Camry Hybrid also uses an advanced electric motor. This powertrain allows the vehicle to produce up to an EPA-estimated 40 combined mpg.
And to help the Toyota Camry Hybrid produce even more of a fuel-efficient performance, Toyota has added an Energy Monitor. This monitor shows how the engine, motor and hybrid batteries are performing, so you the driver gets a better idea of the vehicle's fuel economy and performance.
